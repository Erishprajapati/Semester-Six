# 🚀 Enhanced Data Generation for Crowd Prediction Model

## 📋 Overview

The enhanced data generation script (`generate_time_based_crowd_data.py`) has been significantly upgraded with advanced features to create more realistic and culturally-aware crowd prediction data for Nepali tourist places.

## 🆕 New Features Implemented

### 1. **PLACE_OVERRIDES Dictionary**
**Purpose:** Apply place-specific crowd boosts for particular time slots and seasons

**Implementation:**
```python
PLACE_OVERRIDES = {
    'Pashupatinath Temple': {
        'morning': {'Spring': 15, 'Autumn': 20, 'Winter': 10},  # Peak prayer times
        'evening': {'Spring': 10, 'Autumn': 15, 'Winter': 5},   # Evening aarti
        'special_boost': 25  # Always gets extra boost due to significance
    },
    'Thamel': {
        'morning': {'Summer': -10, 'Winter': 5},  # Summer heat reduces morning activity
        'afternoon': {'Summer': -15, 'Winter': 10},  # Summer heat significantly reduces afternoon
        'evening': {'Summer': 5, 'Winter': 15},  # Evening is always busy
        'special_boost': 30  # Major tourist hub
    }
}
```

**Logic:**
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Different crowd levels based on seasons
- **Time Slot Specific:** Morning, afternoon, evening have different patterns
- **Special Boosts:** Significant places get permanent crowd boosts
- **Negative Adjustments:** Summer heat reduces activity in certain places

### 2. **FESTIVAL_PLACE_BOOSTS Dictionary**
**Purpose:** Apply crowd boosts on specific festival dates for relevant places

**Implementation:**
```python
FESTIVAL_PLACE_BOOSTS = {
    '2025-10-20': {  # Dashain (Major Hindu festival)
        'Pashupatinath Temple': 50,      # Major temple gets huge boost
        'Swayambhunath Stupa': 40,       # Buddhist site also gets boost
        'Thamel': 20,                    # Tourist area
        'Asan Bazaar': 35,               # Shopping for festival
        'default_boost': 10              # All other places get small boost
    }
}
```

**Festivals Covered:**
- **Dashain (October):** Major Hindu festival - temples and shopping areas get huge boosts
- **Tihar (November):** Festival of Lights - cultural sites and markets get boosts
- **Nepali New Year (April):** Celebrations across all major sites
- **Janai Purnima (August):** Religious ritual - temples get significant boosts

### 3. **DISTRICT_SCALING Dictionary**
**Purpose:** Scale crowd levels based on district's population intensity

**Implementation:**
```python
DISTRICT_SCALING = {
    'Kathmandu': 1.2,    # Most populous and busy district
    'Lalitpur': 1.1,     # Second most populous
    'Bhaktapur': 1.0,    # Standard scaling
    'default': 1.0       # Default scaling for unknown districts
}
```

**Logic:**
- **Kathmandu:** 20% higher crowd levels (most populous)
- **Lalitpur:** 10% higher crowd levels (second most populous)
- **Bhaktapur:** Standard scaling (baseline)
- **Other districts:** Default scaling applied

### 4. **Enhanced Randomness**
**Purpose:** Add realistic variability to crowd predictions

**Implementation:**
```python
# Enhanced randomness: ±15% on weekends, ±10% on weekdays
if is_weekend:
    random_factor = random.uniform(-0.15, 0.15)  # ±15% on weekends
else:
    random_factor = random.uniform(-0.10, 0.10)  # ±10% on weekdays
crowd_level *= (1 + random_factor)
```

**Logic:**
- **Weekends:** Higher variability (±15%) due to unpredictable family outings
- **Weekdays:** Lower variability (±10%) due to more predictable work routines
- **Realistic Fluctuations:** Mimics real-world crowd behavior

## 🔄 Enhanced Crowd Level Calculation Process

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Base Crowd Level:** Start with category-specific base levels
2. **Weekend Boost:** Add weekend boost if applicable
3. **Holiday Boost:** Add holiday boost if applicable
4. **Weather Impact:** Apply weather-based adjustments
5. **Place-Specific Overrides:** Apply seasonal and time-slot specific adjustments
6. **Special Boost:** Add significance-based boost for major places
7. **Festival Boosts:** Apply festival-specific boosts if date matches
8. **District Scaling:** Multiply by district population factor
9. **Enhanced Randomness:** Apply weekend/weekday specific randomness
10. **Bounds Check:** Ensure final value is between 0-100%

### Mathematical Formula:
```
Final_Crowd_Level = (
    (Base_Level + Weekend_Boost + Holiday_Boost + Weather_Impact + 
     Place_Override + Special_Boost + Festival_Boost) * 
    District_Scaling * (1 + Random_Factor)
) clamped_to_0_100
```

## 📊 Data Quality Improvements

### Before Enhancement:
- **Records:** ~30,000 basic time-based records
- **Variability:** Simple ±10% randomness
- **Factors:** Basic category, time, weather patterns
- **Realism:** Limited cultural and place-specific considerations

### After Enhancement:
- **Records:** ~31,000 enhanced records with realistic patterns
- **Variability:** Intelligent ±15% weekends, ±10% weekdays
