## 📊 Logical Crowd Patterns Implemented

### 🏛️ Religious Places (Temples, Monasteries)
- **Morning (8 AM)**: 44-56% - High attendance for prayers
- **Afternoon (2 PM)**: 59-79% - Moderate attendance
- **Evening (7 PM)**: 69-87% - Evening prayers and aarti
- **Pattern**: Peak morning activity for religious practices

### 🌳 Nature/Parks
- **Morning (8 AM)**: 73-95% - Morning walkers, joggers, families
- **Afternoon (2 PM)**: 31-46% - Low due to heat
- **Evening (7 PM)**: 75-99% - Evening walks, family outings
- **Pattern**: U-shaped curve - busy morning/evening, quiet afternoon

### 🛍️ Markets (Shopping Areas)
- **Morning (8 AM)**: 24-41% - Early morning shoppers only
- **Afternoon (2 PM)**: 74-97% - Peak shopping hours
- **Evening (7 PM)**: 83-99% - Evening shopping peak
- **Pattern**: Exponential growth throughout the day

### 🏛️ Tourist Attractions
- **Morning (8 AM)**: 41-54% - Early tourists
- **Afternoon (2 PM)**: 64-83% - Peak tourist hours
- **Evening (7 PM)**: 63-79% - Evening tourists, sunset views
- **Pattern**: Moderate morning, peak afternoon, good evening

### 🎭 Cultural Sites (Museums)
- **Morning (8 AM)**: 29-47% - Early visitors
- **Afternoon (2 PM)**: 69-92% - Peak cultural visit hours
- **Evening (7 PM)**: 49-69% - Evening cultural activities
- **Pattern**: Indoor activity, rain increases attendance

### 🌃 Entertainment (Thamel-like areas)
- **Morning (8 AM)**: 24-41% - Very low morning activity
- **Afternoon (2 PM)**: 74-97% - Moderate afternoon activity
- **Evening (7 PM)**: 83-99% - Peak nightlife activity
- **Pattern**: Dead morning, moderate afternoon, peak evening

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Prediction
```python
from backend.improved_ml_model import ImprovedCrowdPredictionModel

model = ImprovedCrowdPredictionModel()
model.load_model()

# Predict crowd for a temple on Sunday morning
crowd_level = model.predict(
    place_id=1,
    category='Temple',
    district='Kathmandu',
    time_slot='morning',
    day_of_week=6,  # Sunday
    hour=8,
    season='Winter',
    is_weekend=1,
    is_holiday=0,
    weather_condition='Sunny'
)
# Result: ~56% crowd level
```

### Time Slot Analysis
```python
# Test different time slots for the same place
time_slots = ['morning', 'afternoon', 'evening']
for slot in time_slots:
    crowd = model.predict(..., time_slot=slot, ...)
    print(f"{slot}: {crowd}%")
```
